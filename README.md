This is an extremely simple version of an NVDA Remote Access server written in Go.

I came across this server after I had already written my original server in Go, and forked it before the original developer deleted his repository. As such, I still have it as part of my repositories, and have made a couple updates to it here and there.

However, this server will remain extremely simple, enough to get the job done, but nothing more. No configuration files, and no logging except to the console.

Now that automatic certificate generation is included in this server, it contains the minimal features I would consider a very simple NVDA Remote Access server requires to get you up and running.

Because this is a simple server, building this server, running it, setting up systemd services, etc, are beyond the scope of this document.
